## Description
   
This terminology extractor enables fast and clear representation of terminology used in English-language scientific papers. <br>
It extracts terminology candidates together with their definitions and context from an unstructured text — in this case, a scientific article in .pdf format — via regex patterns. <br>
A GUI — **optimized for macOS** — allows for browsing through directories, selecting the file and displaying terminology candidates, their possible definitions and context sentences in which they occur.

* re — module supporting use of regex
* os — module providing functions for interacting with the operating system
* Tkinter — Python interface to Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit

## Setup and usage
Clone this repo and install the required libraries. Run the full code by running `GUI.py` or access each module by running them individually.
